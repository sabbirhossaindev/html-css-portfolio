        <p>
          I started learning the program only 1'5 year's ago. Before that I had
          a great interest in the program. After much thought, I took up the
          subject of programming. I have taken the basic concept of Html,
          Html-5, Css, Css3, Bootstrap, Python, c#, c++, Dart, Flutter &
          JavaScript. So far I have worked on 30+ projects. Notable among them
          are HOT-GADETS, PANDA, Birthday-Wish, MY_PROJECT, www.sabbirIT.com,
          Happy New Year Etc.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

          <p>
            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
